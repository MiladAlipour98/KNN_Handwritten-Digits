Parameter Selection for Nearest Neighbor Classifier using Cross Validation: A Case Study on Handwritten Digits
The study specifically applies this methodology to a particular type of data, namely handwritten digits.
It further mentions that the data is obtained from a downloaded dataset, with specific details about the structure of the data and the corresponding class labels.
Project focuses on the implementation of the nearest neighbor classifier and the use of cross-validation for parameter selection. It also specifies that the study is conducted on handwritten digits as the dataset.
